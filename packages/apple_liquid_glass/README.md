Liquid Glass Implementation according to Apple's Guidelines.

## Installation 💻

**❗ In order to start using Apple Liquid Glass you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.**

Install via `flutter pub add`:

```sh
flutter pub add apple_liquid_glass
```

## What is this?

At the moment, this package just exports [`liquid_glass_renderer`](https://pub.dev/packages/liquid_glass_renderer).

The intent for this package is to build upon the basic rendering capabilities of that package later on, to implement Liquid Glass according to Apple's guidelines.
